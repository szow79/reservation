DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true
